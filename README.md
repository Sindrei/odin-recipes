# odin-recipes
This project was created to demonstrate a basic understanding of HTML learned in the early stages of working through the Odin Project.

Skills I have learned and used include the following:
    * The creation and use of headings
    * The use of paragraph tags
    * Importing images using the image tag
    * Using an ordered and an unordered list to list ingredients and steps required
    * Navigation using relative and absolute links. Implemented using the anchor tag

From this basic understanding of html I hope to learn more about building creative and practical websites.
