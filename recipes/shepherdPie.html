        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shepherd's Pie comes to us from England, and is traditionally 
            made with lamb or mutton. A shepherd's pie is basically a 
            casserole with a layer of cooked meat and vegetables, 
            topped with mashed potatoes, and baked in the oven until the 
            mashed potatoes are well browned.
        </p>
        <p>When you dig in you get a spoonful of mashed potatoes, 
            some crispy bits, meat, and vegetables all in one bite. 
            It's pure comfort food.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>3 large (1 1/2 to 2 pounds) potatoes , peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)</li>
            <li>1 to 2 cups mixed vegetables, such as diced carrots, corn, or peas</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds ground round beef</li>
            <li>1/2 cup beef broth</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>Pepper and/or other seasonings of choice</li>  
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Boil the potatoes:</h3>
                Place the peeled and quartered potatoes in medium sized 
                pot. Cover with at least an inch of cold water. Add a 
                teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, 
                and cook until tender (about 20 minutes).
            </li>
            <li><h3>Preheat the oven:</h3>Preheat oven to 205°C</li>
            <li><h3>Sauté the vegetables:</h3>
                <p>While the potatoes are cooking, melt 4 tablespoons of the 
                    butter in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the 
                    chopped onions and cook until tender, about 6 to 10 
                    minutes.
                </p>
                <p>If you are including vegetables, add them 
                    according to their cooking time. Carrots 
                    should be cooked with the onions, because 
                    they take as long to cook as the onions do.
                </p>
                <p>If you are including peas or corn, add them toward the 
                    end of the cooking of the onions, or after the meat 
                    starts to cook, as they take very little cooking time.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Add the ground beef, then the Worcestershire sauce and broth:</h3>
                <p>While the potatoes are cooking, melt 4 tablespoons of the 
                butter in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the chopped 
                onions and cook until tender, about 6 to 10 minutes.
                </p>

                <p>If you are including vegetables, add them according to 
                    their cooking time. Carrots should be cooked with the 
                    onions, because they take as long to cook as the onions 
                    do.
                </p>
                
                <p>you are including peas or corn, add them toward the end 
                    of the cooking of the onions, or after the meat starts 
                    to cook, as they take very little cooking time.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Mash the cooked potatoes:</h3>
                <p>When the potatoes are done cooking (a fork 
                can easily pierce), remove them from the pot 
                and place them in a bowl with the remaining 
                4 tablespoons of butter. Mash with a fork or 
                potato masher, taste, and adjust seasonings 
                with salt and pepper.</p>
                </li>
            <li><h3>Layer the meat mixture and mashed 
                potatoes in a casserole dish:</h3>
                <p>Spread the cooked filling in an even layer in a large 
                    baking dish (such as a 9 x 13-inch casserole.
                </p>
                 <p>Spread the mashed potatoes over the top 
                    of the ground beef. Rough up the surface 
                    of the mashed potatoes with a fork so 
                    there are peaks that will get well 
                    browned. You can even use a fork to make 
                    creative designs in the mashed potatoes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Bake in oven:</h3>
                <p>Place in a 400°F oven and cook until browned and 
                    bubbling, about 30 minutes. If necessary, broil for the 
                    last few minutes to help the surface of the mashed 
                    potatoes brown.
                </p>
                <p>(Be careful when broiling using Pyrex or 
                    glass dishes, they have been known to 
                    shatter under the high heat of the broiler. 
                    It's not a worry if you are using a ceramic 
                    or metal casserole dish.)</p>
